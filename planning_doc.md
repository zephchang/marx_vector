1. try doing 30 summaries [done]

2. try doing 30 book paragraphs from marx [done]

Ugh I hate this

1. Rewrite the python code to create a neworkx embedding and have some way of doing manual embedding checks to see if the embeddings look good. Code should (1) do a manual embedding check (2) pkl things

> get a print version working [done]

> save the similarities and the G so we don't have to run BAII every time [done]

> create some kind of visual debugger maybe streamlit? [done]

> NOTE: these embeddings are fucking dope. Man the NLP people are amazing.

2. Seperate file we are going to do D3. Fuck cytoscape. I hate cytoscape Fuck cytoscape. and Cola and cose and fcose and all this bs.

Get D3 working and stuff [done]

Do some D3 weights and see if we can get lengths in a way that makes sense [done]

Setup main.py to rank links in order by number. That's probably just a link attribute. Then on the script.js side we can serve only a subset. Probably top 5 or you could say top 5 & above threshold of .6 or something like that. [done]

then we can weight them equally or set link length + repel and go from there, maybe that's prettier. I wonder how obsidian does it. Optimize for PRETTY not informational [done]

Ok so now what? I am imagining two use cases. First is to show a graph of a book. The second is to add in notes handful by handful as some kind of progress or growth.

> labels on nodes [done] this does indeed make things look very cool. LLM could do this well.

> different colors for different chapters

> let's try doing a shit ton of nodes.

> let's try just straight up using chapters from marx and see what happens.

> page rank size of node by how many links go to it - and then color red yellow green blue based on size.

> what is the done state? do all of capital (or a bunch of chapters) and get it as pretty as possible.
