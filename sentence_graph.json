Bauer had recently written against Jewish emancipation, from an atheist perspective, arguing that the religion of both Jews and Christians was a barrier to emancipation. In responding to Bauer, Marx makes one of the most enduring arguments from his early writings, by means of introducing a distinction between political emancipation\u2014essentially the grant of liberal rights and liberties\u2014and human emancipation. Marx\u2019s reply to Bauer is that political emancipation is perfectly compatible with the continued existence of religion, as the contemporary example of the United States demonstrates. However, pushing matters deeper, in an argument reinvented by innumerable critics of liberalism, Marx argues that not only is political emancipation insufficient to bring about human emancipation, it is in some sense also a barrier. Liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings who are a threat to our liberty and security. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view overlooks is the possibility\u2014for Marx, the fact\u2014that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. Accordingly, insisting on a regime of liberal rights encourages us to view each other in ways that undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation. Now we should be clear that Marx does not oppose political emancipation, for he sees that liberalism is a great improvement on the systems of feudalism and religious prejudice and discrimination which existed in the Germany of his day.

However, the theoretical role that the concept of alienation plays in his writings might still be said to evolve. For example, it has been suggested that alienation in the early writings is intended to play an \u201cexplanatory role\u201d, whereas in his later work it comes to have a more \u201cdescriptive or diagnostic\u201d function (Wood 1981 [2004: 7]).", "value": 36, "name": "36"}}, {"data": {"id": 37, "content": "", "value": 37, "name": "37"}}, {"data": {"id": 38, "content": "A second concern is the role of human nature in the interpretation of alienation offered here.

However, there is much evidence against this purported later rejection of human nature (see Geras 1983). Indeed, the \u201cmature\u201d Marx explicitly affirms that human nature has both constant and mutable elements; that human beings are characterised by universal qualities, constant across history and culture, and variable qualities, reflecting historical and cultural diversity (McMurtry 1978: 19\u201353). One systematic, rather than exegetical, variant of the present worry suggests that we should not endorse accounts of alienation which depend on \u201cthick\u201d and inevitably controversial accounts of human nature (Jaeggi 2016). Whatever view we take of that claim about our endorsement, there seems little doubt about the \u201cthickness\u201d of Marx\u2019s own account of human flourishing. To provide for the latter, a society must satisfy not only basic needs (for sustenance, warmth and shelter, certain climatic conditions, physical exercise, basic hygiene, procreation and sexual activity), but also less basic needs, both those that are not always appreciated to be part of his account (for recreation, culture, intellectual stimulation, artistic expression, emotional satisfaction, and aesthetic pleasure), and those that Marx is more often associated with (for fulfilling work and meaningful community) (Leopold 2007: 227\u2013245).", "value": 38, "name": "38"}}, {"data": {"id": 39, "content": "", "value": 39, "name": "39"}}, {"data": {"id": 40, "content": "Hegel's dialectical method consists of a three-stage process: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.
